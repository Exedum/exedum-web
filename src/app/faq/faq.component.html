            <p>In order to regulate the liquidity of the project both in the DAO and in Uniswap, 
                the EXED protocol includes a system that protects the project from strong variations by limiting these types of movements. 
                This system is measured in "epoch" where 1 epoch equals 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a user performs movements in the DAO, they will not be able to perform new movements until 15 epoch passes.
                When a user makes movements in the Pool, they will not be able to make new movements until 5 epoch passes.
                When a user redeems EXEDs for coupons, these coupons will only be valid for the next 90 epoch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every 24 hours any user can call the "advance" function to advance an epoch. This updates the value of the token on the platform and 
                the user who calls the function is rewarded with 100 EXED.

            The pool rewards to all its participants when the EXED value is greater than 1.00 USDC on the UniSwap pair and also just for staking.
            </p>
            <p>
            To be a participant in the pool, you must deposit the tokens received by UniSwap as a liquidity provider in the pair "EXED-USDC", hereinafter LP Token.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once the user has the LP Token, he must access the "Pool" section of the app and stage this token and, finally, make the "bond" of these tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once these steps have been completed, you will begin to receive rewards each time a trade on uniswap happens or a user transfers EXED token to another and at each change of "epoch" as long as the value of the token is greater than 1.00 USDC.
            </p>
            <p>
            To claim your rewards you must first carry out "unbound" of the LP Token and then carry out the "claim". At this time you will stop receiving rewards until you make the LP Token "bond" again.
            </p>
            <p>
            With each change that the user makes interacting with the Pool, a 5 epoch movement block will be established.

            <p>
                When the value of EXED is less than 1 USD, users can burn a certain amount of the EXED token, this reduce debt and you obtain 
                coupons instead. This also reduces the amount of existing token and encourages its value to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                To consider:
                <br/>
                - Depending on the value of the token and the debt premium at the time of purchase of the coupon, this will allow the user to 
                recover a higher or lower number of EXED.
                <br/>
                - The coupons will be redeemable again for EXED token at the moment in which the value of EXED returns to 1 USD or higher.
                <br/>
                - The coupons are valid for 90 days, if they are not redeemed for EXED or the value of the token does not recover the value of 1 USD within this period, 
                the coupons are automatically destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose a user who has 1000 EXED. The price of the token drops to 0.98 and begins to generate deductions until reaching a premium of 15%.
                Then the user decides to burn his 1000 EXED for what he will receive 1150 coupons. If at any time during the next 90 days the price 
                of EXED recovers the value of 1 USD or higher, the user will be able to exchange their coupons for 1150 EXED. If the value of the 
                EXED in that time does not recover the value of 1 USD or if it does, but the user does not get to redeem his coupons within 90 days, he will lose his coupons.
